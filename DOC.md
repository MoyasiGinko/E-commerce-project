# User Story 1: Seamless Product Discovery

### Overview

The Seamless Product Discovery user story is designed to provide users with a frictionless and personalized product discovery journey. The system analyzes user preferences, past purchases, and browsing history to present tailored product recommendations on the homepage, within specific categories, and even in product details pages.

### Acceptance Criteria

**User Authentication:**

- Ensure the user is authenticated to enable personalized recommendations.
- Utilize the authentication API from the back-end.
- Confirm successful retrieval of the user's authentication token.

**Personalized Homepage:**

- Create a dedicated section on the homepage for personalized product recommendations.
- Dynamically update recommendations based on user interactions.
- Integrate a product slideshow displaying the most visited products randomly based on user preferences.
- Include a recommendation section based on the most visited category.

**Category-specific Recommendations:**

- Implement logic to fetch and display personalized product recommendations for each category.
- Make API requests to retrieve relevant data based on user preferences within a specific category.
- Create a category page where users can select a category to view all products within that category.

**Product Details Page:**

- Implement a recommendation section on the product details page.
- Display the most relevant products randomly based on the current product's attributes.

**Consistent and Intuitive Design:**

- Maintain a consistent design theme across pages.
- Integrate recommendation sections seamlessly into the user interface.
- Use Redux for state management to ensure a seamless and consistent user experience.

**Recommendation Algorithm:**

- Collaborate with the back-end team to enhance the recommendation algorithm.
- Consider past purchases, product views, and preferences in the algorithm.
- Ensure the algorithm generates accurate and relevant recommendations.
